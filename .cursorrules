  ```typescript
  let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
  ```
- `$effect`: Manage side effects and lifecycle
  ```typescript
  $effect(() => {
    console.log(`Count is now ${count}`);

    return () => {
      console.log('Cleanup function called');
    };
  });
  ```
- `$props`: Declare component props
  ```typescript
  let { optionalProp = 42, requiredProp } = $props();
  ```
- `$bindable`: Create two-way bindable props
  ```typescript
  let { bindableProp = $bindable() } = $props();
  ```

  class Counter {
    count = $state(0);
    incrementor = $state(1);
    
    increment() {
      this.count += this.incrementor;

---

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical Python code with accurate examples.
- Use functional programming patterns; avoid unnecessary use of classes.
- Prefer vectorized operations over explicit loops for performance.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `learning_rate`, `weights`, `gradients`).
- Organize code into functions and modules for clarity and reusability.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

JAX Best Practices

- Leverage JAX's functional API for numerical computations.
  - Use `jax.numpy` instead of standard NumPy to ensure compatibility.
- Utilize automatic differentiation with `jax.grad` and `jax.value_and_grad`.
  - Write functions suitable for differentiation (i.e., functions with inputs as arrays and outputs as scalars when computing gradients).
- Apply `jax.jit` for just-in-time compilation to optimize performance.
  - Ensure functions are compatible with JIT (e.g., avoid Python side-effects and unsupported operations).
- Use `jax.vmap` for vectorizing functions over batch dimensions.
  - Replace explicit loops with `vmap` for operations over arrays.
- Avoid in-place mutations; JAX arrays are immutable.
  - Refrain from operations that modify arrays in place.
- Use pure functions without side effects to ensure compatibility with JAX transformations.

Optimization and Performance

- Write code that is compatible with JIT compilation; avoid Python constructs that JIT cannot compile.
  - Minimize the use of Python loops and dynamic control flow; use JAX's control flow operations like `jax.lax.scan`, `jax.lax.cond`, and `jax.lax.fori_loop`.
- Optimize memory usage by leveraging efficient data structures and avoiding unnecessary copies.
- Use appropriate data types (e.g., `float32`) to optimize performance and memory usage.
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

Error Handling and Validation

- Validate input shapes and data types before computations.
  - Use assertions or raise exceptions for invalid inputs.
- Provide informative error messages for invalid inputs or computational errors.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes during execution.

Testing and Debugging

- Write unit tests for functions using testing frameworks like `pytest`.
  - Ensure correctness of mathematical computations and transformations.
- Use `jax.debug.print` for debugging JIT-compiled functions.
- Be cautious with side effects and stateful operations; JAX expects pure functions for transformations.

Documentation

- Include docstrings for functions and modules following PEP 257 conventions.
  - Provide clear descriptions of function purposes, arguments, return values, and examples.
- Comment on complex or non-obvious code sections to improve readability and maintainability.

Key Conventions

- Naming Conventions
  - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
  - Use `UPPERCASE` for constants.
- Function Design
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
  - Avoid global variables; pass parameters explicitly.
- File Structure
  - Organize code into modules and packages logically.
  - Separate utility functions, core algorithms, and application code.

JAX Transformations

- Pure Functions
  - Ensure functions are free of side effects for compatibility with `jit`, `grad`, `vmap`, etc.
- Control Flow
  - Use JAX's control flow operations (`jax.lax.cond`, `jax.lax.scan`) instead of Python control flow in JIT-compiled functions.
- Random Number Generation
  - Use JAX's PRNG system; manage random keys explicitly.
- Parallelism
  - Utilize `jax.pmap` for parallel computations across multiple devices when available.

Performance Tips

- Benchmarking
  - Use tools like `timeit` and JAX's built-in benchmarking utilities.
- Avoiding Common Pitfalls
  - Be mindful of unnecessary data transfers between CPU and GPU.
  - Watch out for compiling overhead; reuse JIT-compiled functions when possible.

Best Practices

- Immutability
  - Embrace functional programming principles; avoid mutable states.
- Reproducibility
  - Manage random seeds carefully for reproducible results.
- Version Control
  - Keep track of library versions (`jax`, `jaxlib`, etc.) to ensure compatibility.

Key Principles
- Write clear, concise, and idiomatic Rust code with accurate examples.
- Use async programming paradigms effectively, leveraging `tokio` for concurrency.
- Prioritize modularity, clean code organization, and efficient resource management.
- Use expressive variable names that convey intent (e.g., `is_ready`, `has_data`).
- Adhere to Rust's naming conventions: snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and structs.
- Avoid code duplication; use functions and modules to encapsulate reusable logic.
- Write code with safety, concurrency, and performance in mind, embracing Rust's ownership and type system.

Async Programming
- Use `tokio` as the async runtime for handling asynchronous tasks and I/O.
- Implement async functions using `async fn` syntax.
- Leverage `tokio::spawn` for task spawning and concurrency.
- Use `tokio::select!` for managing multiple async tasks and cancellations.
- Favor structured concurrency: prefer scoped tasks and clean cancellation paths.
- Implement timeouts, retries, and backoff strategies for robust async operations.

Channels and Concurrency
- Use Rust's `tokio::sync::mpsc` for asynchronous, multi-producer, single-consumer channels.
- Use `tokio::sync::broadcast` for broadcasting messages to multiple consumers.
- Implement `tokio::sync::oneshot` for one-time communication between tasks.
- Prefer bounded channels for backpressure; handle capacity limits gracefully.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` and `tokio::sync::RwLock` for shared state across tasks, avoiding deadlocks.

Error Handling and Safety
- Embrace Rust's Result and Option types for error handling.
- Use `?` operator to propagate errors in async functions.
- Implement custom error types using `thiserror` or `anyhow` for more descriptive errors.
- Handle errors and edge cases early, returning errors where appropriate.
- Use `.await` responsibly, ensuring safe points for context switching.

Testing
- Write unit tests with `tokio::test` for async tests.
- Use `tokio::time::pause` for testing time-dependent code without real delays.
- Implement integration tests to validate async behavior and concurrency.

- Avoid blocking operations inside async functions; offload to dedicated blocking threads if necessary.
- Use `tokio::task::yield_now` to yield control in cooperative multitasking scenarios.
- Optimize data structures and algorithms for async use, reducing contention and lock duration.
- Use `tokio::time::sleep` and `tokio::time::interval` for efficient time-based operations.

Key Conventions
1. Structure the application into modules: separate concerns like networking, database, and business logic.
2. Use environment variables for configuration management (e.g., `dotenv` crate).
3. Ensure code is well-documented with inline comments and Rustdoc.

Async Ecosystem
- Use `tokio` for async runtime and task management.
- Leverage `hyper` or `reqwest` for async HTTP requests.
